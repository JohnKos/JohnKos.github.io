A/B experiments are commonly used in research to compare the effects of changing one or more variables in two different experimental groups a control group and a treatment group. While the benefits of using A/B experiments are widely known and accepted in education, there is less agreement on an approach to creating software infrastructure systems to assist in rapidly conducting such experiments in the field. To assist in alleviating this gap, we are creating a software infrastructure for A/B experiments that allows researchers to conduct experiments and automatically analyze their results for an education-focused ecology-based conceptual modeling platform.
