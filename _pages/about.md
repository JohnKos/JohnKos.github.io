Summary
========

Hi, I am a second year PhD student at the Design Intelligence Lab at Georgia Tech  working under Professor [Ashok Goel](link him). I am studying Computer Science in the 
school of Interactive Computing. My research lies at the intersection of AI and education, where I try to build a holistic understanding of pedagogy and figuring out the
unique challenges that come with teaching people to solve open ended problems. This takes the form of Personalized Learning and AI explanation.

[A Constructivist Framing of Wheel Spinning: Identifying Unproductive Behaviors with Sequence Analysis](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-63028-6_14)
-------
*Published at Intelligent Tutoring Systems 2024*

Abstract: Despite the increasing prevalence of inquiry-based learning (IBL) platforms, IBL research still has many open questions in constructivist contexts,
such as when to offer help. In this paper, we explore wheel spinning in an open-domain inquiry-based modeling platform. We establish why closed-domain conceptions
of wheel spinning do not work well in open domains, and we postulate key features of a working characterization of wheel spinning for an open-domain IBL platform. 
We also present a comparative quasi-experimental study of two groups of learners: While both groups worked with the same publicly available IBL platform called VERA, 
one group used VERA in a large graduate class at Georgia Tech and the other group was composed of globally-distributed self-directed learners (SDLs) who accessed VERA 
through various public websites. We use sequential pattern mining on the results in order to determine what wheel spinning looks like on the VERA platform and how to best 
identify it. Generalizing, we apply this research to the quitting behaviors of SDLs. Finally, modeling both user groups' action sequences into Markov chains, we identify
the stage at which an IBL platform may offer proactive feedback to the learners.

[Using Comparative Machine Learning Methods to Validate Educational Content](/files/Kos_comparative.pdf)
-------
*Submitting Soon*

Abstract: Validation as a field of study is important to the development
of educational Interactive Learning Environments (ILEs).
However, as ILEs become more complex, borrowing from
fields such as agent-based modeling, simulation, and "serious games", the educational domain has lagged in adopting
the rigorous validation standards typical in these fields. Traditional methods, such as face validation by subject matter
experts, are often criticized for their subjectivity and lack of
thoroughness for validating pedagogical content or underlying theory. To address this, we present a machine learning-
based methodology to validate the content and educational
theory of ILEs in the context of complex systems. By demonstrating automated labeling of time-series data from EMSS,
an ecology focused agent-based modeling and simulation
tool, we report a success rate of 92.79% on a manually collected sample. This promising result not only validates EMSS
but also suggests the broader applicability of our approach to
other time series-based ILEs.
