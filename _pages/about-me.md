Summary
========

Outside of academia, my hobbies include reading science fiction and doing amateur game design. Additionally I organize Tournements for Super Smash Bros Melee here at Georgia Tech. If you would like to shoot me a message and discuss non academic topcis,
my personal email is johnkos01@gmail.com. I hope this page will fill out in more depth as I complete personal projects going forward. I am excited to show off stuff I have been working on!
